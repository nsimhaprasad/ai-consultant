# Summary of main.py

## Overview
`main.py` is the core server file for the BAID (Beskar AI Developer) application, which is an AI consultant service built with FastAPI. The server integrates with Google's Vertex AI for reasoning engines to provide AI-powered assistance to users.

## Key Components

### 1. Server Setup and Configuration
- Uses FastAPI as the web framework
- Configures logging for monitoring and debugging
- Loads environment variables for configuration
- Sets up CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests
- Initializes a PostgreSQL database connection pool

### 2. Authentication System
- Implements Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
- Handles token exchange and user information retrieval
- Creates and validates JWT tokens for session management
- Stores user information in the PostgreSQL database

### 3. Database Integration
- Uses asyncpg for asynchronous PostgreSQL connections
- Manages user sessions and message history
- Implements functions for storing and retrieving user data, sessions, and messages
- Supports Google Cloud Secret Manager for secure database credentials

### 4. AI Integration
- Connects to Google's Vertex AI Reasoning Engines
- Creates and manages AI sessions for users
- Handles streaming responses from the AI model
- Supports both word-by-word streaming and chunk-based streaming

### 5. API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/google-login`: Handles Google OAuth redirect and token exchange
- `/api/auth/session`: Retrieves OAuth session information
- `/consult`: Main endpoint for AI consultation with streaming responses
- `/sessions/{user_id}`: Lists all sessions for a user
- `/history/{user_id}/{session_id}`: Retrieves message history for a session
- `/health`: Health check endpoint for monitoring
- `/`: Root endpoint with basic server information

### 6. Session Management
- Creates and tracks user sessions with the AI
- Maps users to their sessions in the database
- Provides endpoints for retrieving and deleting sessions

### 7. Message Handling
- Stores all user messages and AI responses in the database
- Implements streaming response handling for real-time interaction
- Supports different streaming modes for flexibility

## Deployment
The application is containerized using Docker with a multi-stage build process:
1. A builder stage that installs all dependencies
2. A production stage that creates a slim image with only runtime dependencies
3. Includes database migration scripts that run before the application starts

The server is designed to be deployed to cloud environments, with specific support for Google Cloud Run.

## Security Features
- JWT-based authentication
- Non-root user in Docker container
- Secret management using Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Database connection pooling for efficiency and security
- CORS configuration to control access

## Conclusion
`main.py` serves as the central component of the BAID server, handling authentication, database operations, and AI integration. It provides a robust API for client applications to interact with the AI consultant service, with features like streaming responses and session management to enhance the user experience.

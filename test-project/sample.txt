The spike in cases has been attributed to the growing penetration of internet services and digital media usage in semi-urban and rural areas, the report added. Cybercriminals typically operate by targeting random phone numbers, making rural populations as vulnerable as urban users.

Increased accessibility to reporting mechanisms has also contributed to the rise in complaints. According to the DH report, victims now have the option to directly call the 1930 cybercrime helpline or lodge complaints online, making the process less cumbersome than before.


A recent incident in Khanapur, Belagavi district, saw an elderly couple die by suicide after being targeted in a cyber fraud and fearing digital arrest, highlighting the severe psychological toll such crimes can take.

The deceased have been identified as Diogjeron Santan Nazareth, a retired Maharashtra government secretariat employee, and his wife Flaviana. The couple had no children.
